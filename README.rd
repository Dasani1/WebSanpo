# About

**WebSanpo** is a web app that allows users to explore the walkability of any area on the map.  
By selecting a location, users can view color-coded regions that reflect how walkable the surrounding area is — based on predefined or customizable factors such as proximity to grocery stores, parks, and other amenities.

It’s built to help people who enjoy walking or biking find the best places to live, visit, or explore.

More features coming soon.

### Name Origin

**WebSanpo** combines “website” and **Sanpo** (散歩), the Japanese word for “leisure walk.”  
The name reflects our goal: to help people enjoy their surroundings on foot.
